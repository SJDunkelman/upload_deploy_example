# Upload & Deploy

Context:

Before upload.py and deploy.py are used, an Astro JS project will have been created and populated with files in /temp/<UUID>

## Upload.py
The logic I need implementing:
1. Create new repo using the github account smth_github
2. Add remote URL to the website we're deploying in temp folder e.g. /temp/4a7383f3-b8eb-41ee-86ac-db3458bf24c0
3. Add all files currently in that
